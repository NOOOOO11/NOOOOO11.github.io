            <h1>Welcome to</h1>
            <h1 style="color: #7413dc; font-size: 70px;">Minchinhampton Scouts!</h1>
            <p>Scouts are do-ers and give-it-a-go-ers. Yes, we go camping, hiking, swimming, abseiling, cycling and canoeing. But we also get to hang out with our friends every week â€“  having fun, playing games, working in a team and taking on new challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We believe that through adventure we challenge individuals so that they learn and experience new things that enrich their lives.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The aim of the Association is to promote the development of
                young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, social and
                spiritual potential, as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of
                their local, national and international communities.</p>
                <br>
            <p> 
                The Method of achieving the Aim of the Association is by
                providing an enjoyable and attractive scheme of progressive training, based on
                the Scout Promise and Law, and guided by adult leadership.</p>
